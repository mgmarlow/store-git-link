;; A tiny emacs package for sharing code links with colleagues. Currently
;; supports Github and Sourcehut.
;;
;; - `store-git-link': Copies a link to the current line of code.
;; - `store-git-link-commit': Copies a link to the commit hash associated
;;   responsible for the current line of code, determined via git blame.
